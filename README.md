                place ij_ridge_detect-1.4.0-J6Public.jar inside Fiji's installation .\Plugins folder.
            --way A2:(suggested, tested stable)

        install python and spyder3 (and pyimagej by way 2)

                FijiAppPath = r"D:\\GreenSoft\\Fiji.app52p" # Fiji installation path
            
    # then run the whole script in Spyder3.
        # note, the first run may take time to auto-download supporting files..
        # after Fiji panel pop up, run this script again to start processing images.
